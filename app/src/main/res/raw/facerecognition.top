proposal: %facerecogn before I ask you all the specifics for our program, I'd like to know if you
                      want me to remember your face for the next time, in order to help each other update your information
                      in a smoother way. What do you say?
    u1:(~confirm) %confirmation Ok cool! ^enableThenGoto(facerecognition)
    u1:(~rejection) %repeatquestion ok. Remember that if you want to update any privacy information for my privacy enforcement program, the next time
                    you will have to repeat the process all over again. Are you sure you don't want me to remember your face?
        u2:(~confirm) %continue ok, let's continue then. ^gotoInTopic(startInitialize,initializebuildlistobj)
        u2:(~rejection) %decline ok, so do you confirm you want to me to remember your face for the next time?
             u3:(~confirm) ^enableThenGoto(confirmation)
             u3:(~rejection) Then I'll not save your face in my memory. ^enableThenGoto(continue)
             u3:(e:Dialog/NotUnderstood) What did you say? I didn't really understand what you just said. Let me repeat,maybe it can be helpful. ^enableThenGoto(decline)
        u2:(e:Dialog/NotUnderstood) What did you say? I didn't really understand what you just said. Let me repeat,maybe it can be helpful. ^enableThenGoto(repeatquestion)

    u1:(e:Dialog/NotUnderstood) What did you say? I didn't really understand what you just said. Let me repeat,maybe it can be helpful. ^enableThenGoto(facerecogn)


proposal: %facerecognition To allow me to remember your face, I have to ask you to look me in the eyes
                            for a couple of seconds. Please hold still^execute(TakePicExecutor) ^enableThenGoto(testiamo0)


proposal: %facerecognitionSucc ok now I'll remember your face for the next time! Neat! ^gotoInTopic(startInitialize,initializebuildlistobj)


proposal: %StopEvent4 Sorry, but something went wrong, images are not clear. Please when you are ready and look me in the eyes
            and tell me "i'm ready".
        u1:(~ready) ok, hold still for a second. ^execute(TakePicExecutor) --ok now I'll remember your face for the next time! Neat! ^gotoInTopic(startInitialize,initializebuildlistobj)
        u1:(~rejection) ^enableThenGoto(repeatquestion)
         u1:(e:Dialog/NotUnderstood) What did you say? I didn't really understand what you just said. Let me repeat,maybe it can be helpful. ^enableThenGoto(StopEvent4)
